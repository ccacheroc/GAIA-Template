# GAIA-Template

**GAIA-Template** is an advanced, open-source project template designed to support
**Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** using AI agents. It provides a robust operational
structure, enforceable rules, and reusable workflows to guide the systematic
generation of high-quality React applications backed by REST APIs.

This repository serves both as a **reference implementation** of the GAIA approach
and as a **practical starting point** for AI-assisted software development projects.

## What does this template include?

The core of the template is an advanced AI-agent configuration located in the
`.agent/` directory, which acts as the project's **operational intelligence layer**:

### 🔹 Rules (`.agent/rules/`)
A curated set of enforceable directives that ensure quality, consistency, and
governance across the project lifecycle, including:

- Operational philosophy and Definition of Done (DoD)
- Architectural and data model standards
- Backend and frontend security checklists
- Testing protocols and Git conventions

### 🔹 Skills (`.agent/skills/`)
Specialized capabilities that extend the agent’s behavior, such as:

- Backend domain generation with FastAPI
- Premium frontend design and brand identity management
- Automated code reviews
- Integrations with Playwright

### 🔹 Workflows (`.agent/workflows/`)
Automated processes that orchestrate common development activities, including:

- Technical discovery and planning (user stories, tickets, implementation plans)
- Error correction and fix cycles
- Security audits and artifact governance
